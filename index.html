          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            The PlayStation version of <b><i>Rick Dangerous</i></b> is a
            faithful homebrew port developed by Old Pirate, a well-known retro
            enthusiast with a strong focus on <b>Sega 32X</b> development and
            preservation. Rather than reimagining the game, this release stays
            true to the <b>original experience</b>, directly inheriting the
            structure, mechanics, and level design that made Rick Dangerous a
            classic. The result is a <b>near-perfect adaptation</b>near-perfect
            adaptation for Sony’s console, reflecting the author’s commitment to
            accuracy, respect for the source material, and deep technical
            knowledge of legacy hardware.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rick Dangerous is a classic action-platformer inspired by old
            adventure serials like Indiana Jones. You play as Rick, a fearless
            (and very fragile) explorer who travels through deadly locations
            filled with traps, enemies, and hidden dangers. The goal is to
            survive each level by memorizing layouts, avoiding instant-death
            traps, and carefully using Rick’s limited weapons and tools, such as
            his pistol or explosives. Gameplay is deliberately punishing:
            progress comes through trial and error, precise movement, and
            learning when to advance or retreat. Every screen is a puzzle of
            timing and reflexes, where one wrong step can mean instant death.

          <h2>Extra Info</h2>
          <img src="IMG/core.png" alt="Core Design Limited" class="core" />
          <p>
            Before reaching the original PlayStation, Rick Dangerous had already
            received a notable revival through a dedicated Sega 32X port made by
            the developer Chilly Willy, which plays a key role in understanding
            the PS1 version. This 32X release was conceived as a faithful
            adaptation of the original 1989 Core Design game, preserving its
            structure, level layouts, mechanics, and unforgiving difficulty
            exactly as they were. This version became especially important years
            later, as it effectively served as the technical base for the
            PlayStation port. The PS1 release is, in practice, a direct port of
            the 32X version, meaning it does not introduce new mechanics,
            altered levels, or redesigned systems. Instead, it focuses on
            accuracy and preservation, delivering the same brutal
            trial-and-error gameplay that defined the original release.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            n terms of gameplay, both the 32X and PSX versions retain the
            hallmark features of Rick Dangerous: instant-death traps, tight
            platforming, limited ammunition, and levels designed around
            memorization and caution. Progress depends entirely on learning from
            failure, as hazards often trigger without warning and leave no
            margin for improvisation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rick Dangerous was officially released on classic home computers
            such as the Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and
            Amstrad CPC. Over the years, the game has also received an
            impressive number of fan-made and homebrew ports, expanding its
            reach to modern and alternative platforms including Windows, Linux,
            MSX, Acorn Archimedes, Mega Drive, 32X, GameCube, PlayStation 2,
            Xbox, Wii, and more recently the original PlayStation.
